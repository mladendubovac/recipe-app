# Recipe App

This is a Recipe application created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

## API Endpoint

The application uses the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch meal data. The base URL for the API is `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1`.

## Scripts

- `npm test`: Runs tests in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency from your project. **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
